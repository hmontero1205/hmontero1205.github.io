My name is Hans and I am a software engineer based out of NYC. I currently work on Google's distributed filesystem.

I previously attended Columbia University where I completed my bachelor's in
2021 and my master's in 2022, both in computer science on the software systems
track.

Teaching
--------

### Associate in Computer Science @ Columbia University
In Spring 2023, I'll be teaching [cs4118 Operating Systems I]() alongside Prof.
Jae Woo Lee.

### Teaching Assistant @ Columbia University
While I was an undergrad and master's student at Columbia, I TA'd four classes:

* [cs3157 Advanced Programming](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/3157-LAST/):
  a.k.a. Columbia's systems programming course with a narrative. TA'd 8x over
  2017-2022.
* [cs4118 Operating Systems I](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4118-LAST/): OS
  theory reinforced by Linux kernel hacking.  TA'd 4x over 2020-2022.
* [cs4115 Programming Languages and
  Translators](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2021/4115-spring/index.html):
  language design and compiler internals. students design and implement a
  language with `ocaml[lex|yacc]` that targets LLVM IR.
* [cs4995 C++ for C Programmers](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4995-LAST/)

I also worked on [`pygrader`](https://github.com/hmontero1205/pygrader), a
framework for grading coding assignments. This framework is used in cs4118 and
cs4995.

Industry
--------
I joined Google as a software engineer in June 2022. My team is part of Google's distributed
filesystem and our objective is enable low-latency and reliable file reads and
writes.

Before graduating, I completed three internships:
* Google: optimized eBPF programs on the linux kernel networking team. Summer
  2021.
* Google: contributed to XLS, an open-source Rust-like language that targets Verilog for FPGA programmers. Summer 2020.
* Bloomberg L.P.: implemented reporting capabilities for a chaos engineering
  framework. Summer 2019.

Personal
--------
I'm trying my best to have a life outside of coding xD... My interests include
cooking, dancing, bouldering, and gaming (barely maintaining a positive K/D
ratio in CoD).
