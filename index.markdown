Hey there!
==========

My name is Hans and I am a software engineer living in NYC. I currently work on
Google's distributed filesystem,
[Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system).

I previously attended Columbia University where I completed my bachelor's in
2021 and my master's in 2022, both in computer science on the software systems
track.

You can reach me via email at

### GIR Teaching Assistant @ Cal State Fullterton
[Google in
Residence](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/googleinresidence)
(GIR) is a program that matches Google software engineers with Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs)
to teach introductory computer science.

For the Fall 2024 semester, I'll be a virtual TA for CPSC 120: Introduction to
Programming (in C++). I'll be reviewing course materials and developing grading
infrastructure.

### Google CSFirst @ Harmony School, Saltillo, MX
[CSFirst](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/s/en/home) is a free, online curriculum
that teaches introductory CS in Scratch to elementary/middle schoolers. The
curriculum is available in several languages, not just English.

In September 2023, I had the opportunity to help remotely teach two cohorts of
middle schoolers at the Harmony School in Saltillo, Mexico. I guided the cohorts
through introductory game design, completely in Spanish.

### Teaching Assistant @ Columbia University
While I was an undergrad and master's student at Columbia, I TA'd four classes:

* [cs3157 Advanced Programming](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/3157-LAST/):
  a.k.a. Columbia's systems programming course with a narrative. TA'd 8x over
  2018-2022.
* [cs4118 Operating Systems I](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4118-LAST/): OS
  theory reinforced by Linux kernel hacking.  TA'd 4x over 2020-2022.
* [cs4115 Programming Languages and
  Translators](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2021/4115-spring/index.html):
  language design and compiler internals. students design and implement a
  language with `ocaml[lex|yacc]` that targets LLVM IR.
* [cs4995 C++ for C Programmers](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4995-LAST/)

I also worked on [`pygrader`](https://github.com/hmontero1205/pygrader), a
framework for grading coding assignments. This framework is used in cs3157,
cs4118 and cs4995.

### Advisor @ Codecademy
From May 2018 to December 2018, I was an online advisor for Codecademy's Pro
Intensive courses.

My main role was to give 1:1 live support to students working through
introductory courses in Java, Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I also reviewed
project submissions and mentored students participating in months-long courses
about intermediate Java/Python programming, data science, and web development.

Industry
--------
I joined Google as a software engineer in June 2022. My team is part of Google's
[Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system)
distributed filesystem and our objective is to enable low-latency and
reliable file reads and writes.

Before graduating, I completed three internships:
* Google: optimized eBPF programs on the linux kernel networking team. Summer
  2021.
* Google: contributed to [`XLS`](https://github.com/google/xls), an open-source
  Rust-like language that targets Verilog for FPGA programmers. Summer 2020.
* Bloomberg L.P.: implemented reporting capabilities for a chaos engineering
  framework. Summer 2019.
